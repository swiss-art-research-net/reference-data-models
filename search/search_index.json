The artwork is taken here in the sense of a movable, physical work of some sort such as would be typically inventoried by a museum. Specific documentation of elements of an artwork depends highly upon the kind of artwork it is. This reference model does not intend to cover such specificities but to remain at a general level description, providing a consolidated, high-level reference data model of most commonly reused descriptors for an artwork and to provide for these, in turn, a set of standard semantic mappings to the CIDOC CRM. Moreover, each field is marked with regards to its potential functionality with regards to instance matching between overlapping datasets. This reference data model aims to serve a number of functions including: to support the creation of semantic data entry forms that will create \u2018born semantic\u2019 data streams to serve as a reference guide in designing eventually compatible data structures for feeding into larger aggregations of Cultural Heritage data to guide mapping processes of extant data sources with common mapping patterns to be adopted by institutions acting as aggregation hubs in order to create consistent re-expressions of extant reference information in a common CIDOC-CRM based expression. Sources \u00b6 The decision on which fields to represent was based on a survey of significant, extant data sources of interest to the project. These were: Acronym Source Name Official Access Point Schema Documentation Maintained by CDWA Categories for the Description of Works of Art http://www.getty.edu/research/publications/electronic_publications/cdwa/introduction.html http://www.getty.edu/research/publications/electronic_publications/cdwa/definitions.html Getty CCO Cataloging Cultural Objects http://cco.vrafoundation.org/index.php/ http://cco.vrafoundation.org/index.php/toolkit/cco_pdf_version/ CCO Commons VRA Core Visual Resources Association core categories http://www.loc.gov/standards/vracore/schemas.html http://www.loc.gov/standards/vracore/VRA_Core4_Element_Description.pdf Visual Resources Association DC Dublinc Core http://dublincore.org/ http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/ Dublin Core Metadata Initiative Model Sections Description \u00b6 The fields used to describe an artwork can be functionally grouped according to higher level units in order to allow for an easier approach to the entry and navigation of the data by information category. The information categories identified have been enumerated in the following table. # Name Function 1 Names and Classifications This category gathers together descriptors used for assigning names and types to an artwork, both at present and historically. 2 Description This category is used to gather together information regarding significant descriptions given of a work by known authors/sources. 3 Part/Whole This category is used to bring together information relevant to the mereological relations between an artwork and its parts. 4 Existence This category gathers together descriptors relevant to the tracking of the creation and destruction of an artwork. 5 Actor Relations This category gathers together descriptors relevant to tracking the significant relations between the artwork and known actors. Primary of such relations are those of creator to the work. 6 Substance This category gathers together descriptors used for stating the physical constitutional features of the documented artwork. 7 Representation This category gathers together descriptors regarding the representational level recognised to be present in the documented artwork. 8 Events This category gathers together information about significant documented events that an artwork may go through. 9 Location This category gathers together information regarding the present location of a documented artwork. 10 Rights This category gathers together information regarding the rights claims on a documented artwork. 11 Documentation This category gathers together different descriptors that provide reference information with regards to an artwork. Names and Classifications \u00b6 The attribution of names and types to artwork, as with other entities, is a basic human activity. A chief factor in disambiguating artworks lies in understanding the various names and identifiers that have been given to them at different moments in their individual histories. Likewise, additional classifiers of the artwork, such as how it has been classified as an object as such, give important distinguishing characteristics. identifier Model Specific Name Model Specific Description CRM Path used by artwork_1_identifier Identifier This field is used to indicate an identifier attributed to the documented instance of artwork. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1_1] \u2192 P190 \u2192 rdfs:Literal Swiss Art Research Infrastructure artwork_2_identifier_type Identifier Type This field is used to indicate the type of an identifier attributed to the documented artwork. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1_1] \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55[2_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure artwork_3_identifier_provider Identifier Provider This field is used to indicate the institution providing the artwork it's ID. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1_1] \u2192 P37i \u2192 E15[3_1] \u2192 P14 \u2192 E39[3_2] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure artwork_4_identifier_source Identifier Source This field is used to indicate the main name attributed to the documented artwork. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1_1] \u2192 P37i \u2192 E15[3_1] \u2192 P16 \u2192 E73[4_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure artwork_5_name Title This field is used to indicate the main title attributed to the documented artwork. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E33_E41[5_1] \u2192 P190 \u2192 rdfs:Literal \u2192 P1 \u2192 E33_E41[5_1] \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55[5_2]{'preferred terms'} Swiss Art Research Infrastructure artwork_6_name_language Title Language This field is used to record the language of the main title attributed to the documented artwork. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E33_E41[5_1] \u2192 P72 \u2192 E56[6_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure artwork_17_type Type This field is used to indicate the formal type of object an artwork is. \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55[17_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure artwork_10_alternative_name Alternative Title This field is used to indicate additional names under which the documented artwork is known.

Description \u00b6 Artworks are the subjects of innumerable descriptions that provide a wide range of information with regards to the aesthetic and historical importance of a work, inter alia . Such descriptions are of use in a scholarly understanding of an artwork and its reception just in case we are able to track the provenance of such elocutions in a systematic fashion. Such an aim drives the need for the tracking of description information as a separate category. The descriptors necessary to this task are documented in the table below. identifier Model Specific Name Model Specific Description CRM Path used by artwork_188_description Description This field is used to indicate a description of documented artwork \u2192 P129i \u2192 E33[188_1] \u2192 P190 \u2192 rdfs:Literal Swiss Art Research Infrastructure artwork_189_description_language Description Language This field is used to record the language of the description of the documented artwork. \u2192 P129i \u2192 E33[188_1] \u2192 P72 \u2192 E56[189_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure artwork_190_description_type Description Type This field is used to indicate the type of description given of the documented work. \u2192 P129i \u2192 E33[188_1] \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55[190_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure artwork_191_description_author Description Author This field is used to indicate the author of the description given of the documented work. \u2192 P129i \u2192 E33[188_1] \u2192 P94i \u2192 E65[191_1]>-P14 \u2192 E39[191_2] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure artwork_192_description_date_-_earliest Description Date - Earliest This field is used to indicate the ealiest date for the creation of the description of the documented work. \u2192 P129i \u2192 E33[188_1] \u2192 P94i \u2192 E65[191_1] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[191_2] \u2192 P82a \u2192 xsd:dateTime Swiss Art Research Infrastructure artwork_193_description_date_-_latest Description Date - Latest This field is used to indicate the latest date for the creation of the description of the documented work. \u2192 P129i \u2192 E33[188_1] \u2192 P94i \u2192 E65[191_1] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[191_2] \u2192 P82b \u2014> xsd:dateTime Swiss Art Research Infrastructure artwork_194_description_-_source Description - Source This field is used to record the source of the description of the documented artwork. \u2192 P129i \u2192 E33[188_1] \u2192 P94i \u2192 E65[191_1] \u2192 P16 \u2192 E73[194_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure These descriptors should be deployed together in order to provide full context to \u2018text blobs\u2019 by means of authorship, type of description as well as the time of articulation.

The artwork is taken here in the sense of a movable, physical work of some sort such as would be typically inventoried by a museum. Specific documentation of elements of an artwork depends highly upon the kind of artwork it is. This reference model does not intend to cover such specificities but to remain at a general level description, providing a consolidated, high-level reference data model of most commonly reused descriptors for an artwork and to provide for these, in turn, a set of standard semantic mappings to the CIDOC CRM. Moreover, each field is marked with regards to its potential functionality with regards to instance matching between overlapping datasets. This reference data model aims to serve a number of functions including: to support the creation of semantic data entry forms that will create \u2018born semantic\u2019 data streams to serve as a reference guide in designing eventually compatible data structures for feeding into larger aggregations of Cultural Heritage data to guide mapping processes of extant data sources with common mapping patterns to be adopted by institutions acting as aggregation hubs in order to create consistent re-expressions of extant reference information in a common CIDOC-CRM based expression.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"et/artwork/#sources","text":"The decision on which fields to represent was based on a survey of significant, extant data sources of interest to the project.

The scope of this reference model is the bibliographic item as information object and pointer to real world instances of the publication; this model aims to provide a streamlined list of common descriptors for a bibliographic item and not a complete representation of all aspects of a real bibliographic record. Rather, we are interested here in representing the types of information that are typically gathered by scholars relative to a publication in their creation of bibliographies for use in scholarship and used as the basis for citations. This reference model aims to remain at a general level description, providing a consolidated, high level reference data model of most commonly reused descriptors for a bibliographic item as such and to provide for these in turn a set of standard semantic mappings to the CIDOC CRM. Moreover, each field is marked with regards to its potential functionality with regards to instance matching between overlapping datasets. This level of modelling is seen as a necessary basic reference point on which to build more complex documentation. This reference data model aims to serve a number of functions including: to support the creation of semantic data entry forms that will create \u2018born semantic\u2019 data streams to serve as a reference guide in designing eventually compatible data structures for feeding into larger aggregations of Cultural Heritage data to guide mapping processes of extant data sources with common mapping patterns to be adopted by institutions acting as aggregation hubs in order to create consistent re-expressions of extant reference information in a common CIDOC-CRM based expression. Sources \u00b6 In formulating this reference model, we have made reference to some well known bibliographic standards, but in practice found it most useful to refer to commonly used bibliography generation tools such as Zotero to identify required fields.

The information categories identified have been enumerated in the following table. # Name Function 1 Names and Classifications This category gathers together descriptors used for assigning names and types to a bibliographic item, both at present and historically. 2 Description This category is used to gather together information regarding significant descriptions given of the bibliographic item by known authors/sources. 3 Parthood This category is used to bring together information relevant to the mereological relations between a bibliographic item and other bibliographic items. 4 Existence This category gathers together descriptors relevant to the tracking of the creation of a bibliographic item. 5 Actor Relations This category gathers together descriptors relevant to tracking the significant relations between the bibliographic item and known actors. Primary of such relations are those of creator to the work. 6 Substance This category gathers together descriptors used for stating the physical constitutional features of the documented bibliographic item. 7 Aboutness This category gathers together descriptors regarding the topic coverage recognised to be covered in the documented bibliographic item. 8 Item Information This category gathers together information regarding physical holdings of a bibliographic item held by institutions . 9 Documentation This category gathers together different descriptors that provide reference information with regards to a bibliographic item.. Names and Classifications \u00b6 The attribution of names and types to bibliographic item, as with other entities, is a basic human activity. In the context of bibliographic items, titles and subtitles as well as the language of these are of high importance in tracing the individual bibliographic item. identifier Model Specific Name Model Specific Description CRM Path used by bibliographic entity_1_identifier Identifier This field is used to indicate an identifier attributed to the documented bibliographic item. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1_1] \u2192 P190 \u2192 rdfs:Literal Swiss Art Research Infrastructure bibliographic entity_2_identifier_type Identifier Type This field is used to indicate the type of an identifier attributed to the documented bibliographic item. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1_1] \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55[2_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure bibliographic entity_3_identifier_provider Identifier Provider This field is used to indicate the provider of the identifier attributed to the documented bibliographic item. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1_1] \u2192 P37i \u2192 E15[3_1] \u2192 P14 \u2192 E39[3_2] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure bibliographic entity_4_identifier_source Identifier Source This field is used to indicate the source based on which the identifier was attributed to the bibliographic item. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1_1] \u2192 P37i \u2192 E15[3_1] \u2192 P16 \u2192 E73[4_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure bibliographic entity_17_type Type This field is used to indicate the form of the bibliographic item. \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55[17_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure bibliographic entity_5_name Name This field is used to indicate the main name attributed to the documented bibliographic item.

The scope of this reference model is the bibliographic item as information object and pointer to real world instances of the publication; this model aims to provide a streamlined list of common descriptors for a bibliographic item and not a complete representation of all aspects of a real bibliographic record. Rather, we are interested here in representing the types of information that are typically gathered by scholars relative to a publication in their creation of bibliographies for use in scholarship and used as the basis for citations. This reference model aims to remain at a general level description, providing a consolidated, high level reference data model of most commonly reused descriptors for a bibliographic item as such and to provide for these in turn a set of standard semantic mappings to the CIDOC CRM. Moreover, each field is marked with regards to its potential functionality with regards to instance matching between overlapping datasets. This level of modelling is seen as a necessary basic reference point on which to build more complex documentation. This reference data model aims to serve a number of functions including: to support the creation of semantic data entry forms that will create \u2018born semantic\u2019 data streams to serve as a reference guide in designing eventually compatible data structures for feeding into larger aggregations of Cultural Heritage data to guide mapping processes of extant data sources with common mapping patterns to be adopted by institutions acting as aggregation hubs in order to create consistent re-expressions of extant reference information in a common CIDOC-CRM based expression.","title":"Bibliographic Item Reference Data Model"},{"location":"et/bibliographic_item/#sources","text":"In formulating this reference model, we have made reference to some well known bibliographic standards, but in practice found it most useful to refer to commonly used bibliography generation tools such as Zotero to identify required fields.

Built work is taken here in the sense of a - typically - immovable building, or significant individual part thereof, made for some human use-function such as habitation. The fuller documentation of a built work would establish the relation of the physical work to the series of intellectual and social processes related to the production of such works, such as architectural plans, meetings, construction episodes, detailed use and modification history, specific topological relations and so on. This reference model does not intend to cover such specificities but to remain at a more general level, providing a consolidated, high-level reference data model of most commonly used descriptors for a built work and to provide for these, in turn, a set of standard semantic mappings to the CIDOC CRM. This level of modelling is seen as a necessary basic reference point on which to build more complex documentation. This reference data model aims to serve a number of functions including: to support the creation of semantic data entry forms that will create \u2018born semantic\u2019 data streams to serve as a reference guide in designing eventually compatible data structures for feeding into larger aggregations of Cultural Heritage data to guide mapping processes of extant data sources with common mapping patterns to be adopted by institutions acting as aggregation hubs in order to create consistent re-expressions of extant reference information in a common CIDOC-CRM based expression. Sources \u00b6 The decision on which fields to represent was based on a survey of significant, extant data sources of interest to the project. These were: Acronym Source Name Official Access Point Schema Documentation Maintained by Schema.org Schema.org http://schema.org nan Schema.org EU-Chic EU Cultural Heritage Identity Card http://euchic.eu http://euchic.eu/index.php/news/entry/chiceberg/ EU-Chic BWR Built Work Registry http://builtworksregistry.org nan Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) MIDAS MIDAS Heritage http://www.heritage-standards.org.uk/midas-heritage/ http://heritage-standards.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MIDAS_Heritage_2012_update-_v5.doc English Heritage CARARE nan http://pro.carare.eu/doku.php?id=start http://pro.carare.eu/doku.php?id=support:metadata-schema nan POLIS DTD Guide to Interoperationality of Cultural Heritage Information https://www.ics.forth.gr/CULTUREstandards/paradotea.htm nan ICS-FORTH Model Sections Description \u00b6 The fields used to describe a built work can be functionally grouped according to higher level units in order to allow for an easier approach to the entry and navigation of the data by information category. The information categories identified have been enumerated in the following table. # Name Function 1 Names and Classifications This category gathers together descriptors used for assigning names and types to a built work, both at present and historically. 2 Description This category is used to gather together information regarding significant descriptions given of a built work by known authors/sources. 3 Parthood This category is used to bring together information relevant to the mereological relations between a built work and its parts. 4 Existence This category gathers together descriptors relevant to the tracking of the construction and destruction of a built work. 5 Actor Relations This category gathers together descriptors relevant to tracking the significant relations between the built work and known actors. Primary of such relations are those of the architect and builders of the built work. 6 Substance This category gathers together descriptors used for stating the physical constitutional features of the documented built work. 7 Aboutness This category gathers together descriptors used to record the subject of representation of the documented physical object 8 Events This category gathers together information about significant documented events that a built work typically may go through in the course of it existence. 9 Location This category gathers together information regarding the present location of a documented built work. 10 Designation Status This category gathers together information regarding the designated statuses assigned to a built work. 11 Rights This category gathers together information regarding the rights that a right holder holds over the built work. 12 Documentation This category gathers together different descriptors that provide reference information with regards to a built work. Names and Classifications \u00b6 The attribution of names and types to built work, as with other entities, is a basic human activity. A chief factor in disambiguating built works lies in understanding the various names and identifiers that have been given to them at different moments in their individual histories. Likewise, additional classifiers of the built work, such as how it has been formally classified, give important distinguishing characteristics. identifier Model Specific Name Model Specific Description CRM Path used by builtwork_1_identifier Identifier This field is used to indicate an identifier attributed to the documented built work. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1_1] \u2192 P190 \u2192 rdfs:Literal Swiss Art Research Infrastructure builtwork_2_identifier_type Identifier Type This field is used to indicate the type of an identifier attributed to the documented built work. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1_1] \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55[2_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure builtwork_3_identifier_provider Identifier Provider This field is used to indicate the institution providing the documented built work it's ID. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1_1] \u2192 P37i \u2192 E15[3_1] \u2192 P14 \u2192 E39[3_2] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure builtwork_4_identifier_source Identifier Source This field is used to indicate the source based on which the identifier was attributed to the object. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1_1] \u2192 P37i \u2192 E15[3_1] \u2192 P16 \u2192 E73[4_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure builtwork_5_name Name This field is used to indicate the main name attributed to the documented instance of built work. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E33_E41[5_1] \u2192 P190 \u2192 rdfs:Literal \u2192 P1 \u2192 E33_E41[5_1] \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55[5_2]{'preferred terms'} Swiss Art Research Infrastructure builtwork_6_name_language Name Language This field is used to indicate the language of the name attributed to the documented built work. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E33_E41[5_1] \u2192 P72 \u2192 E56[6_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure builtwork_17_type Type This field is used to indicate the formal type of the documented built work. \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55[17_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure builtwork_10_alternative_name Alternative Name This field is used to indicate additional names under which the documented instance of built work is known.

Description \u00b6 Built works are the subjects of innumerable descriptions that provide a wide range of information with regards to the aesthetic and historical importance of the work, inter alia . Such descriptions are of use in a scholarly understanding of a built work just in case we are able to track the provenance of such elocutions in a systematic fashion. Such an aim drives the need for the tracking of description information as a separate category. The descriptors necessary to this task are documented in the table below. identifier Model Specific Name Model Specific Description CRM Path used by builtwork_188_description Description This field is used to indicate a description of the documented instance of built work. \u2192 P129i \u2192 E33[188_1] \u2192 P190 \u2192 rdfs:Literal Swiss Art Research Infrastructure builtwork_189_description_language Description Language This field is used to indicate the language of the description of the documented built work. \u2192 P129i \u2192 E33[188_1] \u2192 P72 \u2192 E56[189_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure builtwork_190_description_type Description Type This field is used to indicate the type of description given of the documented instance of built work. \u2192 P129i \u2192 E33[188_1] \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55[190_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure builtwork_191_description_author Description Author This field is used to indicate the author of the description given of the documented instance of built work. \u2192 P129i \u2192 E33[188_1] \u2192 P94i \u2192 E65[191_1]>-P14 \u2192 E39[191_2] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure builtwork_192_description_date_-_earliest Description Date - Earliest This field is used to indicate the earliest possible date for the creation of the description of the documented instance of built work. \u2192 P129i \u2192 E33[188_1] \u2192 P94i \u2192 E65[191_1] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[191_2] \u2192 P82a \u2192 xsd:dateTime Swiss Art Research Infrastructure builtwork_193_description_date_-_latest Description Date - Latest This field is used to indicate the latest possible date for the creation of the description of the documented instance of built work. \u2192 P129i \u2192 E33[188_1] \u2192 P94i \u2192 E65[191_1] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[191_2] \u2192 P82b \u2014> xsd:dateTime Swiss Art Research Infrastructure builtwork_194_description_-_source Description - Source This field is used to indicate the source of the description of the documented built work. \u2192 P129i \u2192 E33[188_1] \u2192 P94i \u2192 E65[191_1] \u2192 P16 \u2192 E73[194_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure These descriptors should be deployed together in order to provide full context to \u2018text blobs\u2019 by means of authorship, type of description as well as the time of articulation.

Parthood \u00b6 Built works may require documentation not just as a whole, but with regards to their parts. This information category gathers together the basic descriptors typically deployed to this end. The parthood relations of built works are both highly important information in understanding of this type of work and also highly complex to document. In this base model, we represent simply the relation of belonging of one Built Work to another. An extended model would take account of mereological and topological relations in a much richer way. At the basic reference level, however, this level of detail is not necessary. identifier Model Specific Name Model Specific Description CRM Path used by builtwork_25_has_part Has Part This field is used to indicate individually documented parts of the documented builtwork. \u2192 P46 \u2192 E22[25_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure builtwork_26_has_part_type Has Part Type This field is used to indicate parts of the documented instance of built work. \u2192 P46 \u2192 E22[25_1] \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55[26_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure builtwork_27_part_count Part Count This field is used to indicate a part count for the documented built work. \u2192 P57 \u2192 rdfs:Literal Swiss Art Research Infrastructure Turtle Encoding @prefix crm: <http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/> . <https://example.org/physical_object/E22> a crm : E22_Human-Made_Object ; crm : P2_has_type <https://example.org/type/builtwork> ; crm : P46_is_composed_of <https://example.org/physical_object/fie_25_1> ; crm : P57_has_number_of_parts \"content\" . <https://example.org/physical_object/fie_25_1> a crm : E22_Man_Made_Object ; crm : P2_has_type <https://example.org/type/fie_26_1> . <https://example.org/type/builtwork> a crm : E55_type . <https://example.org/type/fie_26_1> a crm : E55_Type . Existence \u00b6 Of essential importance in identifying and tracking built works is information pertaining to their existence, particularly regarding their construction and destruction dates. For this reason, we have clustered descriptors relevant to such information in a common \u2018existence\u2019 category. These are described in the table below. identifier Model Specific Name Model Specific Description CRM Path used by builtwork_58_production_date_-_earliest Construction Date - Earliest This field is used to indicate the earliest date for the construction of the documented instance of built work. \u2192 P108i \u2192 E12[58_1] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[58_2] \u2192 P82a \u2192 xsd:dateTime Swiss Art Research Infrastructure builtwork_59_production_date_-_latest Construction Date - Latest This field is used to indicate the latest date for the construction of the documented instance of built work. \u2192 P108i \u2192 E12[58_1] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[58_2] \u2192 P82b \u2192 xsd:dateTime Swiss Art Research Infrastructure builtwork_60_production_location Construction Location This field is used to indicate the place of the construction of the documented instance of built work. \u2192 P108i \u2192 E12[58_1] \u2192 P7 \u2192 E53[60_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure builtwork_61_production_period Construction Period This field is used to indicate the historical period in which the construction of the documented instance of built work occured. \u2192 P108i \u2192 E12[58_1] \u2192 P10 \u2192 E4[61_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure builtwork_62_destruction_date_-_earliest Destruction Date - Earliest This field is used to indicate the earliest date for the destruction of the documented instance of built work. \u2192 P13i \u2192 E6[62_1] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[62_2] \u2192 P82a \u2192 xsd:dateTime Swiss Art Research Infrastructure builtwork_63_destruction_date_-_latest Destruction Date - Latest This field is used to indicate the latest date for the destruction of the documented instance of built work. \u2192 P13i \u2192 E6[62_1] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[62_2] \u2192 P82b \u2192 xsd:dateTime Swiss Art Research Infrastructure builtwork_64_destruction_location Destruction Location This field is used to indicate the location of the destruction of the documented instance of built work. \u2192 P13i \u2192 E6[62_1] \u2192 P7 \u2192 E53[64_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure builtwork_65_destruction_period Destruction period This field is used to indicate the historical period in which the destruction of the documented instance of built work occured. \u2192 P13i \u2192 E6[62_1] \u2192 P10 \u2192 E4[65_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure The above structure allows for the documentation of time of construction and destruction of a built work as a whole. Note that while ontologically speaking the agency of the architect and builder in the events of construction could be documented as part of this information unit, we have instead clustered this data in the actors Relations category.

Actor Relations \u00b6 The connection between a built work and actors provides another important set of descriptors for identifying and tracing it.

Built work is taken here in the sense of a - typically - immovable building, or significant individual part thereof, made for some human use-function such as habitation. The fuller documentation of a built work would establish the relation of the physical work to the series of intellectual and social processes related to the production of such works, such as architectural plans, meetings, construction episodes, detailed use and modification history, specific topological relations and so on. This reference model does not intend to cover such specificities but to remain at a more general level, providing a consolidated, high-level reference data model of most commonly used descriptors for a built work and to provide for these, in turn, a set of standard semantic mappings to the CIDOC CRM. This level of modelling is seen as a necessary basic reference point on which to build more complex documentation. This reference data model aims to serve a number of functions including: to support the creation of semantic data entry forms that will create \u2018born semantic\u2019 data streams to serve as a reference guide in designing eventually compatible data structures for feeding into larger aggregations of Cultural Heritage data to guide mapping processes of extant data sources with common mapping patterns to be adopted by institutions acting as aggregation hubs in order to create consistent re-expressions of extant reference information in a common CIDOC-CRM based expression.","title":"Built Work Reference Data Model"},{"location":"et/built_work/#sources","text":"The decision on which fields to represent was based on a survey of significant, extant data sources of interest to the project.

A digital object is meant in the sense of a digitally encoded information object represented as bit sequences that have been encoded with a particular format and can be digitally decoded and represented to an end user of a digital information system. Digital objects are often stored as reference or documentation objects relative to cultural heritage items such as textual descriptions stored as PDFs, documentary images, 3D representations and so on. Digital Objects can also form cultural heritage objects in their own right, though this model does not aim to represent this potential aspect of the digital object. Because of the choice to model, the digital object in its role as a secondary documentary resource, the reference data model has been kept as light as possible. This reference model intends to remain at a general level description, providing a consolidated, high-level reference data model of most commonly reused descriptors for a digital object and to provide for these, in turn, a set of standard semantic mappings to the CIDOC CRM. Moreover, each field is marked with regards to its potential functionality with regards to instance matching between overlapping datasets. This reference data model aims to serve a number of functions including: to support the creation of semantic data entry forms that will create \u2018born semantic\u2019 data streams to serve as a reference guide in designing eventually compatible data structures for feeding into larger aggregations of Cultural Heritage data to guide mapping processes of extant data sources with common mapping patterns to be adopted by institutions acting as aggregation hubs in order to create consistent re-expressions of extant reference information in a common CIDOC-CRM based expression. Sources \u00b6 The minimal metadata set for a digital object was abstracted from typical use scenarios in CMS systems related to cultural heritage. Model Sections Description \u00b6 The fields used to describe a digital object can be functionally grouped according to higher level units in order to allow for an easier approach to the entry and navigation of the data by information category. The information categories identified have been enumerated in the following table. # Name Function 1 Names and Classifications This category gathers together descriptors used for assigning names and types to a digital object, both at present and historically. 2 Parthood This category is used to bring together information relevant to the mereological relations between a digital object and its parts. 3 Existence This category gathers together descriptors relevant to the tracking of the creation of a digital object. 4 Actor Relations This category gathers together descriptors relevant to tracking the significant relations between the digital object and known actors. 5 Substance This category gathers together descriptors used for stating the measurable attributes of the digital object. 6 Representation This category gathers together descriptors regarding the representational level recognised to be present in the documented digital object. 7 Rights This category gathers together information regarding the rights claims on a documented digital object. 8 Location This category gathers together information regarding the present location of a documented digital object. 9 Documentation This category gathers together different descriptors that provide reference information with regards to a digital object. Names and Classifications \u00b6 The attribution of identifiers, names and types to a digital object, as with other entities, is a basic human activity. It is crucial to document these aspects in order to be able to store and retrieve the correct digital object. identifier Model Specific Name Model Specific Description CRM Path used by digital object_1_identifier Identifier This field is used to indicate an identifier attributed to the documented instance of digital object. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1_1] \u2192 P190 \u2192 rdfs:Literal Swiss Art Research Infrastructure digital object_5_name Name This field is used to indicate the main name attributed to the documented digital object. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E33_E41[5_1] \u2192 P190 \u2192 rdfs:Literal \u2192 P1 \u2192 E33_E41[5_1] \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55[5_2]{'preferred terms'} Swiss Art Research Infrastructure digital object_17_type Type This field is used to indicate the formal type of the digital object with regards to its content. \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55[17_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure digital object_17_type Type nan \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55[17_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure digital object_1_identifier Identifier nan \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1_1] \u2192 P190 \u2192 rdfs:Literal Swiss Art Research Infrastructure digital object_2_identifier_type Identifier Type This field is used to record the type of the identifier attributed to the documented instance of digital object. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1_1] \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55[2_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure Turtle Encoding @prefix crm: <http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/> . @prefix crmdig: <http://www.ics.forth.gr/isl/CRMdig/> . @prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> . <https://example.org/conceptual_object/D1> a crmdig : D1_Digital_Object ; crm : P1_is_identified_by <https://example.org/name/fie_1_1> , <https://example.org/name/fie_5_1> ; crm : P2_has_type <https://example.org/type/fie_17_1> . <http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300404670> a crm : E55_Type ; rdfs : label \"preferred terms\" . <https://example.org/name/fie_1_1> a crm : E42_Identifier ; crm : P190_has_symbolic_content \"content\" ; crm : P2_has_type <https://example.org/type/fie_2_1> . <https://example.org/name/fie_5_1> a crm : E33_E41_Linguistic_Appellation ; crm : P190_has_symbolic_content \"content\" ; crm : P2_has_type <http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300404670> . <https://example.org/type/fie_17_1> a crm : E55_Type . <https://example.org/type/fie_2_1> a crm : E55_Type .

A digital object is meant in the sense of a digitally encoded information object represented as bit sequences that have been encoded with a particular format and can be digitally decoded and represented to an end user of a digital information system. Digital objects are often stored as reference or documentation objects relative to cultural heritage items such as textual descriptions stored as PDFs, documentary images, 3D representations and so on. Digital Objects can also form cultural heritage objects in their own right, though this model does not aim to represent this potential aspect of the digital object. Because of the choice to model, the digital object in its role as a secondary documentary resource, the reference data model has been kept as light as possible. This reference model intends to remain at a general level description, providing a consolidated, high-level reference data model of most commonly reused descriptors for a digital object and to provide for these, in turn, a set of standard semantic mappings to the CIDOC CRM. Moreover, each field is marked with regards to its potential functionality with regards to instance matching between overlapping datasets. This reference data model aims to serve a number of functions including: to support the creation of semantic data entry forms that will create \u2018born semantic\u2019 data streams to serve as a reference guide in designing eventually compatible data structures for feeding into larger aggregations of Cultural Heritage data to guide mapping processes of extant data sources with common mapping patterns to be adopted by institutions acting as aggregation hubs in order to create consistent re-expressions of extant reference information in a common CIDOC-CRM based expression.","title":"Digital Object Reference Data Model"},{"location":"et/do/#sources","text":"The minimal metadata set for a digital object was abstracted from typical use scenarios in CMS systems related to cultural heritage.","title":"Sources"},{"location":"et/do/#model-sections-description","text":"The fields used to describe a digital object can be functionally grouped according to higher level units in order to allow for an easier approach to the entry and navigation of the data by information category.

Examples of events would be workshops, meetings, conferences, congresses and so on. The aim of this reference model is to cover basic descriptors that are typically employed in the documentation of an event. This reference model aims to remain at a general level description, providing a consolidated, high-level reference data model of most commonly reused descriptors for an event as such and to provide for these, in turn, a set of standard semantic mappings to the CIDOC CRM. Moreover, each field is marked with regards to its potential functionality with regards to instance matching between overlapping datasets. This level of modelling is seen as a necessary basic reference point on which to build more complex documentation. This reference data model aims to serve a number of functions including: to support the creation of semantic data entry forms that will create \u2018born semantic\u2019 data streams to serve as a reference guide in designing eventually compatible data structures for feeding into larger aggregations of Cultural Heritage data to guide mapping processes of extant data sources with common mapping patterns to be adopted by institutions acting as aggregation hubs in order to create consistent re-expressions of extant reference information in a common CIDOC-CRM based expression. Sources \u00b6 The documented schema for structuring events data, in the sense of planned occasions, documented historically are not generally available or in use, despite the fact that such data is regularly collected in bespoke systems. In order to have reference schema from which to build the model, we looked at work on the more general question of periods and documentation of time along with the schema.org schema for events: Acronym Source Name Official Access Point Schema Documentation Maintained by Schema.org Schema.org http://schema.org nan Schema.org PeriodO nan http://perio.do http://perio.do/technical-overview/#period-collections UNC Chronontology nan http://chronontology.dainst.org/ nan DAI The overlap of general modelling of periods with the question of events is not large. Therefore, the reference model presented was generated on the basis also of tacit knowledge with regards to fields deployed in non-open documentation schemas for documenting events. Model Sections Description \u00b6 The fields used to describe an event can be functionally grouped according to higher level units in order to allow for an easier approach to the entry and navigation of the data by information category. The information categories identified have been enumerated in the following table. # Name Function 1 Names and Classifications This category gathers together descriptors used for assigning names and types to an event, both at present and historically. 2 Description This category is used to gather together information regarding significant descriptions given of an event by known authors/sources. 3 Parthood This category is used to bring together information relevant to the mereological relations between an event and its parts. 4 Existence This category gathers together descriptors relevant to the temporal extent of an event. 5 Participation This category gathers together descriptors relevant to tracking the significant entities that played a role in the event. This has to do both with tracking the participation of actors and their roles in events, but also the use of and creation of documents as the results of events, and the employment of specific tools. 6 Intention This category gathers together descriptors used for describing the goals and aims of an event. 7 Location This category gathers together information regarding where an event took place. 8 Documentation This category gathers together different descriptors that provide reference information with regards to an event. Names and Classifications \u00b6 The attribution of names and types to events, as with other entities, is a basic human activity. A chief factor in disambiguating events lies in understanding the various names and identifiers that have been given to them at different moments in their individual histories. Historical events often receive different names according to the groups naming it, as well as receiving different kinds of names according to contexts (such as abbreviations and so on).

Description \u00b6 Events are the subjects of innumerable descriptions that provide a wide range of information with regards to what took place during the event and how, as well as providing interpretations of its significance and import. Such descriptions are of use in a scholarly understanding of an event just in case we are able to track the provenance of such elocutions in a systematic fashion. Such an aim drives the need for the tracking of description information as a separate category. The descriptors necessary for this task are documented in the table below. identifier Model Specific Name Model Specific Description CRM Path used by event_188_description Description This field is used to indicate a description of the documented instance of event. \u2192 P129i \u2192 E33[188_1] \u2192 P190 \u2192 rdfs:Literal Swiss Art Research Infrastructure event_190_description_type Description Type This field is used to indicate the type of description given of the documented instance of event. \u2192 P129i \u2192 E33[188_1] \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55[190_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure event_191_description_author Description Author This field is used to indicate the author of the description given of the documented instance of event. \u2192 P129i \u2192 E33[188_1] \u2192 P94i \u2192 E65[191_1]>-P14 \u2192 E39[191_2] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure event_192_description_date_-_earliest Description Date - Earliest This field is used to indicate the earliest date for the creation of the description of the documented instance of event. \u2192 P129i \u2192 E33[188_1] \u2192 P94i \u2192 E65[191_1] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[191_2] \u2192 P82a \u2192 xsd:dateTime Swiss Art Research Infrastructure event_193_description_date_-_latest Description Date - Latest This field is used to indicate the latest date for the creation of the description of the documented instance of event. \u2192 P129i \u2192 E33[188_1] \u2192 P94i \u2192 E65[191_1] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[191_2] \u2192 P82b \u2014> xsd:dateTime Swiss Art Research Infrastructure These descriptors should be deployed together in order to provide full context to \u2018text blobs\u2019 by means of authorship, type of description as well as the time of articulation.

Parthood \u00b6 Events are a typical case of the kind of entity whose accurate documentation may require the breaking down of the event into parts and sub-parts. This information category gathers together the basic descriptors typically deployed to this end. The parthood relations of events help contextualize the meaning of events, as well as to be able to pick out the exact composition of a complex event by breaking it down into smaller subunits (e.g. A conference may break down into sessions and sessions into talks). In this base model, we represent simply the relation of belonging of one event to another. identifier Model Specific Name Model Specific Description CRM Path used by event_23_has_part Has Part This field is used to indicate individually documented sub events which form part of the documented event. \u2192 P10i \u2192 E5[23_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure event_24_is_part_of Is Part of This field is used to indicate temporal entities that the documented event falls within. \u2192 P10 \u2192 E5[24_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure Turtle Encoding @prefix crm: <http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/> . <https://example.org/event/E7> a crm : E7_Activity ; crm : P10_falls_within <https://example.org/event/fie_24_1> ; crm : P10i_contains <https://example.org/event/fie_23_1> . <https://example.org/event/fie_23_1> a crm : E5_Event . <https://example.org/event/fie_24_1> a crm : E5_Event . Existence \u00b6 The existence of an event must be determined by documentary or physical evidence of the past. The documentation of the existence of an event, however, essentially relates to ascribing that event dates, where possible, durations otherwise, and a description of the temporality where none of the above is possible. The descriptors and mappings for these potentialities are documented in the table below. identifier Model Specific Name Model Specific Description CRM Path used by event_56_time_description Time Description Author This field is used to provide the author the free text description of the time span of the documented event itself. \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[48_1] \u2192 P129i \u2192 E33[56_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure event_57_preceding_event Preceding Event This field is used to relate an event preceding the documented event, undertaken in preparation for it. \u2192 P20i \u2192 E5[57_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure event_48_earliest_possible_start_date Earliest Possible Start Date This field is used to indicate the earliest possible start date for the event. \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[48_1] \u2192 P82a \u2192 xsd:dateTime Swiss Art Research Infrastructure event_49_latest_possible_start_date Latest Possible Start Date This field is used to indicate the latest possible start date for the event. \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[48_1] \u2192 P81a \u2192 xsd:dateTime Swiss Art Research Infrastructure event_50_earliest_possible_end_date Earliest Possible End Date This field is used to indicate the earliest possible date for the end of a documented instance of event. \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[48_1] \u2192 P81b \u2192 xsd:dateTime Swiss Art Research Infrastructure event_51_latest_possible_end_date Latest Possible End Date This field is used to indicate the latest possible end date for the documented instance of event. \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[48_1] \u2192 P82b \u2192 xsd:dateTime Swiss Art Research Infrastructure event_52_maximal_duration_-_value Maximal Duration - Value This field is used to indicate the time value of the maximal known duration of the event. \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[48_1] \u2192 P84 \u2192 E54[52_1] \u2192 P90 \u2192 xsd:dateTime Swiss Art Research Infrastructure event_53_maximal_duration_-_unit Maximal Duration - Unit This field is used to indicate the unit of the time value of the maximal known duration of the event. \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[48_1] \u2192 P84 \u2192 E54[52_1] \u2192 P91 \u2192 E58 Swiss Art Research Infrastructure event_54_minimal_duration_-_value Minimal Duration - Value This field is used to indicate the time value of the minimal known duration of the event. \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[48_1] \u2192 P83 \u2192 E54[54_1] \u2192 P90 \u2192 xsd:dateTime Swiss Art Research Infrastructure event_55_minimal_duration_-_unit Minimal Duration - Unit This field is used to indicate the unit of the time value of the minimal known duration of the event. \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[48_1] \u2192 P83 \u2192 E54[54_1] \u2192 P91 \u2192 E58[55_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure event_56_time_description Time Description This field is used to indicate a free text describing the time span of the documented instance of event. \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[48_1] \u2192 P129i \u2192 E33[56_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure The above structure allows for the documentation of the begin and end of an event, when known, its duration, as well as linking to motivating events (for example a preparatory meeting), and the plain text description of the temporality of an event.

Participation \u00b6 The use of documenting events in historical studies comes especially in tracing the interaction of actors, ideas and things in time and the evolution of the connections that are created between them. Events are nexuses in which actors, ideas and things participate. They can also be the junction for the creation of new ideas. The descriptors gathered here focus on the typical participants to events in the sense of planned social occasions, especially in a formal context. Therefore they focus on agents and their roles, documents and document production, as well as the use of particular implements (e.g. famous pens) in the carrying out of events. identifier Model Specific Name Model Specific Description CRM Path used by event_129_participant Participant This field is used to indicate actors involved in the documented instance of event. \u2192 P01 \u2192 PC14 [129_1] \u2192 P02 \u2192 E39[129_2] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure event_130_participant_role Participant Role This field is used to indicate the role played by the actors involved in the documented instance of event. \u2192 P01 \u2192 PC14 [129_1] \u2192 P14 \u2192 P14.1[130_1] \u2192 E55 Swiss Art Research Infrastructure event_131_objects_employed Objects Employed This field is used to indicate objects known to have played a role in the documented event. \u2192 P16 \u2192 E18[131_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure event_132_documents_employed Documents Employed This field is used to indicate information objects that are known to have been used during the event.

Examples of events would be workshops, meetings, conferences, congresses and so on. The aim of this reference model is to cover basic descriptors that are typically employed in the documentation of an event. This reference model aims to remain at a general level description, providing a consolidated, high-level reference data model of most commonly reused descriptors for an event as such and to provide for these, in turn, a set of standard semantic mappings to the CIDOC CRM. Moreover, each field is marked with regards to its potential functionality with regards to instance matching between overlapping datasets. This level of modelling is seen as a necessary basic reference point on which to build more complex documentation. This reference data model aims to serve a number of functions including: to support the creation of semantic data entry forms that will create \u2018born semantic\u2019 data streams to serve as a reference guide in designing eventually compatible data structures for feeding into larger aggregations of Cultural Heritage data to guide mapping processes of extant data sources with common mapping patterns to be adopted by institutions acting as aggregation hubs in order to create consistent re-expressions of extant reference information in a common CIDOC-CRM based expression.","title":"Event Reference Data Model"},{"location":"et/event/#sources","text":"The documented schema for structuring events data, in the sense of planned occasions, documented historically are not generally available or in use, despite the fact that such data is regularly collected in bespoke systems.

The intention of this reference model is to provide a consolidated, high-level formal structure comprising the most commonly reused descriptors for a group and, further, to provide for these a set of semantic mapping to the CIDOC CRM. Moreover, each field is marked with respect to its potential functionality with regards to instance matching between overlapping datasets. This reference data model aims to serve a number of functions including: to support the creation of semantic data entry forms that will create \u2018born semantic\u2019 data streams to serve as a reference guide in designing eventually compatible data structures for feeding into larger aggregations of Cultural Heritage data to guide mapping processes of extant data sources with common mapping patterns to be adopted by groups acting as aggregation hubs in order to create consistent re-expressions of extant reference information in a common CIDOC-CRM based expression.

The information categories identified have been enumerated in the following table. # Name Function 1 Names and Classifications This information category gathers together descriptors used for assigning names and types to a group, both at present and historically. 2 Existence This information category gathers together descriptors relevant to the tracking of the formation and dissolution of a group. 3 Parthood This category is used to bring together information relevant to the composition of a group with relation to its parts and its belonging to wider groups. 4 Actor Relations This information category gathers together descriptors relevant to tracking the relations held between a group and other people or actors. 5 Activities This information category gathers together descriptors used for documenting different activities that a group is known to have been involved in or with. 6 Description This category is used to gather together information regarding significant descriptions given of a group by known authors/sources. 7 Work This information category is used to bring together information relevant to the work which have been produced by the documented group. 8 Location This category gathers together information regarding the seat of a group. 9 Documentation This information category gathers together different documentary descriptors that provide reference information with regards to a group. Names and Classifications \u00b6 The attribution of names and types to things, including groups, is a basic human activity. The disambiguation of groups is aided by the understanding of the various names and identifiers that have been given to a group at different moments in time. Moreover, classifications such as group type and legal status can help in identifying and studying groups over time. identifier Model Specific Name Model Specific Description CRM Path used by group_1_identifier Identifier This field is used to indicate an identifier attributed to the documented group. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1_1] \u2192 P190 \u2192 rdfs:Literal Swiss Art Research Infrastructure group_2_identifier_type Identifier Type This field is used to indicate the type of an identifier attributed to the documented group. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1_1] \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55[2_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure group_3_identifier_provider Identifier Provider This field is used to indicate the provider of the identifier attributed to the documented group. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1_1] \u2192 P37i \u2192 E15[3_1] \u2192 P14 \u2192 E39[3_2] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure group_4_identifier_source Identifier Source This field is used to indicate the source based on which the identifier was attributed to the object. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1_1] \u2192 P37i \u2192 E15[3_1] \u2192 P16 \u2192 E73[4_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure group_5_name Name This field is used to indicate the main name attributed to the documented group.

Existence \u00b6 Of essential importance in identifying and tracking groups is to know when they came into existence and if they have gone out of existence. For this reason, we have clustered descriptors relevant to such information into a common \u2018existence\u2019 category. These are described in the table below. identifier Model Specific Name Model Specific Description CRM Path used by group_79_formation_date_-_earliest Formation Date - Earliest This field is used to indicate the earliest known date for the formation of the documented group. \u2192 P95i \u2192 E66[79_1] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[79_2] \u2192 P82a \u2192 xsd:dateTime Swiss Art Research Infrastructure group_80_formation_date_-_latest Formation Date - Latest This field is used to indicate the latest known date for the formation of the documented group. \u2192 P95i \u2192 E66[79_1] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[79_2] \u2192 P82b \u2192 xsd:dateTime Swiss Art Research Infrastructure group_81_formation_location Formation Location This field is used to indicate the the documented group's location of formation. \u2192 P95i \u2192 E66[79_1] \u2192 P7 \u2192 E53[81_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure group_82_formed_from Formed from This field is used to associate a group which pre-existed the document group and from which it was formed. \u2192 P95i \u2192 E66[79_1] \u2192 P151 \u2192 E74[82_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure group_83_dissolution_date_-_earliest Dissolution Date - Earliest This field is used to indicate the earliest known date for the dissolution of the documented group. \u2192 P99i \u2192 E68[83_1] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[83_2] \u2192 P82a \u2192 xsd:dateTime Swiss Art Research Infrastructure group_84_dissolution_date_-_latest Dissolution Date - Latest This field is used to indicate the latest known date for the dissolution of the documented group. \u2192 P99i \u2192 E68[83_1] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[83_2] \u2192 P82b \u2192 xsd:dateTime Swiss Art Research Infrastructure group_85_dissolution_location Dissolution Location This field is used to indicate the location of dissolution of the documented group. \u2192 P99i \u2192 E68[83_1] \u2192 P7 \u2192 E53[85_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure The above structure allows for the documentation of time and place of formation and dissolution of a group.

Parthood \u00b6 Groups often exist in complex internal structuration with both relations of subsumption towards sub-parts of the group and of belonging with regards to larger groups. This is a particular form of social parthood between groups. Groups, therefore, may require documentation not just as a whole, but with regards to their parts. This information category gathers together the basic descriptors typically deployed to this end. identifier Model Specific Name Model Specific Description CRM Path used by group_34_is_member_of Is Member of This field is used to indicate the membership of the documented group in a larger formation. The referenced entity should be a group. \u2192 P107i \u2192 E74[34_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure group_33_has_member Has Member This field is used to indicate the members of the documented group. \u2192 P107 \u2192 E39[33_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure The intention of these part-whole relations is to be used between instances of groups and their parts, larger or smaller. In particular, we have in mind the relationships of proper belonging, where a department belongs to a faculty which in turn belongs to a university. For describing the more general relations of parthood, like the groups belonging to a nation, or more particular relations, like those between actors and the group, please see the actor relations information category.

The intention of this reference model is to provide a consolidated, high-level formal structure comprising the most commonly reused descriptors for a group and, further, to provide for these a set of semantic mapping to the CIDOC CRM. Moreover, each field is marked with respect to its potential functionality with regards to instance matching between overlapping datasets. This reference data model aims to serve a number of functions including: to support the creation of semantic data entry forms that will create \u2018born semantic\u2019 data streams to serve as a reference guide in designing eventually compatible data structures for feeding into larger aggregations of Cultural Heritage data to guide mapping processes of extant data sources with common mapping patterns to be adopted by groups acting as aggregation hubs in order to create consistent re-expressions of extant reference information in a common CIDOC-CRM based expression.","title":"Group Reference Data Model"},{"location":"et/group/#sources","text":"The decision on which fields to represent was based on a survey of significant, extant data sources and schemas of interest to the project.

The intention of this reference model is to provide a consolidated, high-level formal structure comprising the most commonly reused descriptors for a person entity and, further, to provide for these a set of semantic mapping to the CIDOC CRM. Moreover, each field is marked with respect to its potential functionality with regards to instance matching between overlapping datasets. This reference data model aims to serve a number of functions including: to support the creation of semantic data entry forms that will create \u2018born semantic\u2019 data streams to serve as a reference guide in designing eventually compatible data structures for feeding into larger aggregations of Cultural Heritage data to guide mapping processes of extant data sources with common mapping patterns to be adopted by institutions acting as aggregation hubs in order to create consistent re-expressions of extant reference information in a common CIDOC-CRM based expression. Sources \u00b6 The decision on which fields to represent was based on a survey of significant, extant data sources and schemas of interest to the project.

The information categories identified have been enumerated in the following table. # Name Function 1 Names and Classifications This information category gathers together descriptors used for assigning names and types to a person, both at present and historically. 2 Existence This information category gathers together descriptors relevant to the tracking of the birth and death of a person. 3 Social Relations This information category gathers together descriptors relevant to tracking the social relations of a person to other people and actors. 4 Knowledge This information category gathers together descriptors used for documenting the knowledge known to be had by a person. 5 Activities This information category gathers together descriptors used for documenting different activities that a person is known to have been involved in or with. 6 Work This information category is used to bring together information relevant to the work which have been produced by the documented person. 7 Description This category is used to gather together information regarding significant descriptions given of a person by known authors/sources. 8 Documentation This information category gathers together different documentary descriptors that provide reference information with regards to a person. Names and Classifications \u00b6 The attribution of names and types to persons is a basic human activity. A chief factor in disambiguating which person is referred to in historical texts is understanding the various names and identifiers that have been given to an individual at different moments. Likewise, additional classifiers of the individual as such, such as gender, help in the disambiguation, in an information system, of the reference to one real-world individual from another. identifier Model Specific Name Model Specific Description CRM Path used by person_1_identifier Identifier This field is used to indicate an identifier attributed to the documented person. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1_1] \u2192 P190 \u2192 rdfs:Literal Swiss Art Research Infrastructure person_2_identifier_type Identifier Type This field is used to the type of the identifier attributed to the documented person. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1_1] \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55[2_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure person_3_identifier_provider Identifier Provider This field is used to indicate the provider of the identifier attributed to the documented person. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1_1] \u2192 P37i \u2192 E15[3_1] \u2192 P14 \u2192 E39[3_2] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure person_4_identifier_source Identifier Source This field is used to indicate the source based on which the identifer was attributed to the person. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1_1] \u2192 P37i \u2192 E15[3_1] \u2192 P16 \u2192 E73[4_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure person_5_name Name This field is used to record the main name attributed to the documented person. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E33_E41[5_1] \u2192 P190 \u2192 rdfs:Literal \u2192 P1 \u2192 E33_E41[5_1] \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55[5_2]{'preferred terms'} Swiss Art Research Infrastructure person_6_name_language Name Language This field is used to indicate the language of the name attributed to the documented person. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E33_E41[5_1] \u2192 P72 \u2192 E56[6_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure person_7_name_part Name Part This field is used to indicate a type of a specific part of the name attributed to the documented person. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E33_E41[5_1] \u2192 P106 \u2192 E41[7_1] \u2192 rdfs:label \u2192 rdfs:Literal Swiss Art Research Infrastructure person_8_name_part_type Name Part Type This field is used to record the type of the specific part of the name attributed to the documented person. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E33_E41[5_1] \u2192 P106 \u2192 E33_E41[7_1] \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55[8_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure person_17_type Gender This field is used to record the gender ascribed of the documented person. \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55[17_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure person_10_alternative_name Alternative Name This field is used to indicate additional names under which the documented person is known.

The intention of this reference model is to provide a consolidated, high-level formal structure comprising the most commonly reused descriptors for a person entity and, further, to provide for these a set of semantic mapping to the CIDOC CRM. Moreover, each field is marked with respect to its potential functionality with regards to instance matching between overlapping datasets. This reference data model aims to serve a number of functions including: to support the creation of semantic data entry forms that will create \u2018born semantic\u2019 data streams to serve as a reference guide in designing eventually compatible data structures for feeding into larger aggregations of Cultural Heritage data to guide mapping processes of extant data sources with common mapping patterns to be adopted by institutions acting as aggregation hubs in order to create consistent re-expressions of extant reference information in a common CIDOC-CRM based expression.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"et/persons/#sources","text":"The decision on which fields to represent was based on a survey of significant, extant data sources and schemas of interest to the project.

Place here is interpreted as a geometric extent used for locating entities relative to a reference space. The scope of entities that this reference model aims to cover are places as typically documented in gazetteers. Examples of places would be Edmonton (the inhabited city), Alberta (the administrative district), Canada (the country). The aim of this reference model is to cover basic descriptors that are typically employed in the documentation of a place, usually by a gazetteer. This reference model aims to remain at a general level description, providing a consolidated, high-level reference data model of most commonly reused descriptors for a place as such and to provide for these, in turn, a set of standard semantic mappings to the CIDOC CRM. Moreover, each field is marked with regards to its potential functionality with regards to instance matching between overlapping datasets. This level of modelling is seen as a necessary basic reference point on which to build more complex documentation. This reference data model aims to serve a number of functions including: to support the creation of semantic data entry forms that will create \u2018born semantic\u2019 data streams to serve as a reference guide in designing eventually compatible data structures for feeding into larger aggregations of Cultural Heritage data to guide mapping processes of extant data sources with common mapping patterns to be adopted by institutions acting as aggregation hubs in order to create consistent re-expressions of extant reference information in a common CIDOC-CRM based expression. Sources \u00b6 There are many good and well known schema for structuring place data. As a reference for this modelling work, we made use of the TGN, Geonames and Schema.org. The latter two especially are highly reused resources in the historical and cultural heritage field and provide an initial view of the basic complexities to be faced.

The information categories identified have been enumerated in the following table. # Name Function 1 Names and Classifications This category gathers together descriptors used for assigning names and types to a place, both at present and historically. 2 Description This category is used to gather together information regarding significant descriptions given of a place by known authors/sources. 3 Parthood This category is used to bring together information relevant to the mereo-topological relations between a place and its parts. 4 Substance This category gathers together information regarding geospatial documentation of the extent of a place. 5 Documentation This category gathers together different descriptors that provide reference information with regards to a place. Names and Classifications \u00b6 The attribution of names and types to a place, as with other entities, is a basic human activity. A chief factor in disambiguating places lies in understanding the various names and identifiers that have been given to them at different moments in their individual histories. Historical places often receive different names according to the groups naming it, as well as receiving different kinds of names according to contexts and during different historical moments. Likewise, additional classifiers of a place, such as how it is has been formally classified, give important distinguishing characteristics. Because the type of a place is a socially related factor, dependent on how the place is appropriated/used in human interaction, the type of a place may change over time. In the model we add the possibility for describing this shift. identifier Model Specific Name Model Specific Description CRM Path used by place_1_identifier Identifier This field is used to indicate an identifier attributed to the documented place. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1_1] \u2192 P190 \u2192 rdfs:Literal Swiss Art Research Infrastructure place_2_identifier_type Identifier Type This field is used to indicate the type of an identifier attributed to the documented place. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1_1] \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55[2_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure place_3_identifier_provider Identifier Provider This field is used to indicate the institution providing the documented place it's ID. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1_1] \u2192 P37i \u2192 E15[3_1] \u2192 P14 \u2192 E39[3_2] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure place_4_identifier_source Identifier Source This field is used to indicate the source based on which the identifier was attributed to the place. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1_1] \u2192 P37i \u2192 E15[3_1] \u2192 P16 \u2192 E73[4_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure place_17_type Type This field is used to indicate the formal type of place a documented instance of place is classified as. \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55[17_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure place_18_type_start_-_date Type - Start Date This field is used to indicate at what date a place type was specified to hold for a place. \u2192 P41i \u2192 E17[18_1] \u2192 P42 \u2192 E55[17_1] \u2192 P41i \u2192 E17[18_1] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[18_2] \u2192 P82a \u2192 xsd:dateTime Swiss Art Research Infrastructure place_19_type_-_end_date Type - End Date This field is used to indicate at what date a place type was specified to cease to hold for a place. \u2192 P41i \u2192 E17[18_1] \u2192 P42 \u2192 E55[17_1] \u2192 P41i \u2192 E17[18_1] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[18_2] \u2192 P82b \u2192 xsd:dateTime Swiss Art Research Infrastructure place_5_name Name This field is used to indicate the main name attributed to the documented instance of place. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E33_E41[5_1] \u2192 P190 \u2192 rdfs:Literal \u2192 P1 \u2192 E33_E41[5_1] \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55[5_2]{'preferred terms'} Swiss Art Research Infrastructure place_6_name_language Name Language This field is used to indicate the language of the name given to the place. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E33_E41[5_1] \u2192 P72 \u2192 E56[6_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure place_7_name_part Name Part This field is used to indicate a specific part of the name attributed to the documented instance of place. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E33_E41[5_1] \u2192 P106 \u2192 E41[7_1] \u2192 rdfs:label \u2192 rdfs:Literal Swiss Art Research Infrastructure place_8_name_part_type Name Part Type This field is used to indicate the type of the specific part of the name attributed to the documented instance of place. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E33_E41[5_1] \u2192 P106 \u2192 E33_E41[7_1] \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55[8_1] Swiss Art Research Infrastructure place_10_alternative_name Alternative Name This field is used to indicate additional names under which the documented instance of place is known.

Description \u00b6 Places are the subjects of innumerable descriptions that provide a wide range of information with regards to the meaning and use of a place. Such descriptions are of use in a scholarly understanding of a place just in case we are able to track the provenance of such elocutions in a systematic fashion. Such an aim drives the need for the tracking of description information as a separate category.

Parthood \u00b6 The mereo-topological breakdown of places is crucial to understanding the relative relations between places. This information category gathers together the basic descriptors typically deployed to this end. In the study and documentation of place, this is a highly researched topic with extremely fine grained analysis available.

Place here is interpreted as a geometric extent used for locating entities relative to a reference space. The scope of entities that this reference model aims to cover are places as typically documented in gazetteers. Examples of places would be Edmonton (the inhabited city), Alberta (the administrative district), Canada (the country). The aim of this reference model is to cover basic descriptors that are typically employed in the documentation of a place, usually by a gazetteer. This reference model aims to remain at a general level description, providing a consolidated, high-level reference data model of most commonly reused descriptors for a place as such and to provide for these, in turn, a set of standard semantic mappings to the CIDOC CRM. Moreover, each field is marked with regards to its potential functionality with regards to instance matching between overlapping datasets. This level of modelling is seen as a necessary basic reference point on which to build more complex documentation. This reference data model aims to serve a number of functions including: to support the creation of semantic data entry forms that will create \u2018born semantic\u2019 data streams to serve as a reference guide in designing eventually compatible data structures for feeding into larger aggregations of Cultural Heritage data to guide mapping processes of extant data sources with common mapping patterns to be adopted by institutions acting as aggregation hubs in order to create consistent re-expressions of extant reference information in a common CIDOC-CRM based expression.","title":"Place Reference Data Model"},{"location":"et/place/#sources","text":"There are many good and well known schema for structuring place data.

A chief factor in disambiguating places lies in understanding the various names and identifiers that have been given to them at different moments in their individual histories. Historical places often receive different names according to the groups naming it, as well as receiving different kinds of names according to contexts and during different historical moments. Likewise, additional classifiers of a place, such as how it is has been formally classified, give important distinguishing characteristics. Because the type of a place is a socially related factor, dependent on how the place is appropriated/used in human interaction, the type of a place may change over time.

Note : While processing the triples, the script would grab all of them randomly, meaning user would not have much control about the order of statements in the .mmd. However, it also means that running the script over the same RDF file would generate slightly different Mermaid files (i.e. different order of statements), meaning different graphs (i.e. different positions of the nodes). However, the top node's position will remain the same. src \u00b6 The /src folder contains resources used by the main script. /templates \u00b6 The templates folder contains the templates used to generate the .mmd output files. The templates have pre-defined classes for styling: one for visualising instances ( instance.mmd ), the other for visualising only the ontology ( ontology.mmd ). The default styling is based on the color scheme of CIDOC CRM (as proposed by George Bruseker).

It currently contains: - classes : a list object storing the main CIDOC CRM classes that are to be assigned color codes. - onto : a dictionary object storing the filenames of the ontologies used by the script (i.e. the .rdfs files in the folder /ontologies ). :warning: If you replace the .rdfs in the folder /ontologies with an updated file, or rename it, the values in the onto dictionary must be updated accordingly.

Each available template is a collection of descriptors for a specific entity, and each descriptor is mapped to the CIDOC-CRM ontology. The aim is manifold: to provide reference implementations to be used by institutions and projects not familiar with CIDOC-CRM, to create usable guidelines to generate input interfaces for born-CRM semantic data and to guide mapping processes from extant sources into the CRM conformant reference model using tools such as 3M.

If you use CRITERIA and your project is not listed below, do not hesitate to contact us . Project: Reference Data Models Organization: Swiss Art Research Infrastructure, University of Zurich Description: With the term Reference Data Models we denote a re-usable template of common descriptors grounded on the analysis of select sources determined to be of relevance to the entity being modelled. Each available template is a collection of descriptors for a specific entity, and each descriptor is mapped to the CIDOC-CRM ontology. The aim is manifold: to provide reference implementations to be used by institutions and projects not familiar with CIDOC-CRM, to create usable guidelines to generate input interfaces for born-CRM semantic data and to guide mapping processes from extant sources into the CRM conformant reference model using tools such as 3M.
