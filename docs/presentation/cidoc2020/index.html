      <p>Current research methods have many bottlenecks, time consuming activities which are shared and repeated across the community. For many of us, the bottlenecks are linked with diverse types of reference data. We do find ourselves dealing with different types of information about a series of basic entities that populate our databases. Description of Persons, Places, Artworks and their basic characteristics are the backbone of digital research and integration. However, their constant presence signal also the incapacity of current method to help us easily retrieve and integrate this reference data. SARI has extensively worked on the problem and with this work we would like to present an integrative solutions, which we call Semantic Reference Data Models.</p>

                      <p>Our solution to the questions is better integration. we see that one of the major problem in the community is not to transcribe information, but to find easy methods to integrate and query such information.  The problem is intrinsic of the interactions between humans and computers. We do use software to record our knowledge about a topic in the form of structured information which we normally store in excel files, database or just simple notes. </p>

      <p>Such information are structured in respect of a series of needs, and rely on human contextual understanding in order to assign to such information the appropriate semantic value. This is not a new problem, and many domains have developed their own solutions, creating information structure to be followed in order to make the data compatible or at least researchable. All of us most probably have seen the rise of at least one new standards to be followed.</p>

                      <p>If we look at a simple facet of domain, we can see however, that we talk about multiple standards and not a single standard. Each community has developed, for their own needs, a specific set of information to describe a facets of their material or resources. If we think about describing a person, we can easily notice that in the GLAM sectors we have developed a quite large number of standards, some of them are dataset specific, while some of them are large agreements between institutions and agents.</p>

                      <p>An elegant solution to the problem is to translate the data into a common shared information structure, able to characterise the diverse nuances of the recorded information.

                      <p>We saw what the Semantic Reference Model are, but it is important to state that our main target group for this project are the domain specialist and software developers. The former, more often than not, do not have specialised knowledge about ontological patterns, but they have an extensive knowledge of the domain, and using the Semantic Reference Data Models, they can already visualise and plan basic data integration tasks, and why not, trying them themselves. Software Developer or implementers instead do know very well data transformation and engineering tasks, knowledge graph creation as well as querying, but sometimes they do lack understanding of the underlying semantic of the data. Using the Reference Data Models they have in their hand a practical cookbook to use for their transformation.</p>

      <p>The Semantic Reference Data Models can also be the discussion ground, where domain specialist and software developer can meet and understand, together, how to proceed and construct a system that satisfy the requirements of both.</p>
