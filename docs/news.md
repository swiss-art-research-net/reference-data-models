The Semantic Reference Data Models have been updated to be consistent with the very recent release of CIDOC-CRM 7.0. While updating the model, the overall architecture and documentation system has been updated too. Now each **field** has a unique identifier, making way more easier to retrieve and reference it across project. Moreover, the previous tabular and graphical representations of the **fields** have been reviewed, and alongside the classical representations we added a **RDF representation**, useful to get a better grasp of the classes and properties used for each fields.
