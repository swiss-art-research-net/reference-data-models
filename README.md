# Reference Data Models

Repositories focused on discussions and development of the [Reference Data Models](https://docs.swissartresearch.net/instruction/).

With the term Reference Data Models we denote a re-usable template of common descriptors, developed by the [**S**wiss **A**rt **R**esearch **I**nfrastructure project](https://swissartresearch.net), grounded on the analysis of select sources determined to be of relevance to the entity being modelled.  

Each available template is a collection of descriptors for a specific entity, and each descriptor is mapped to the [CIDOC-CRM](http://www.cidoc-crm.org) ontology. The aim is manifold: to provide reference implementations to be used by institutions and projects not familiar with [CIDOC-CRM](http://www.cidoc-crm.org), to create usable guidelines to generate input interfaces for born-CRM semantic data and to guide mapping processes from extant sources into the CRM conformant reference model using tools such as 3M or X3ML. 

The Reference Data Model are produced together with [George Bruseker](https://twitter.com/GBruseker) and described these entities: 

+ [Persons](https://docs.swissartresearch.net/et/persons/)
+ [Artworks](https://docs.swissartresearch.net/et/artwork/)
+ [Group](https://docs.swissartresearch.net/et/group/)
+ [Built Work](https://docs.swissartresearch.net/et/built_work/)
+ [Place](https://docs.swissartresearch.net/et/place/)
+ [Digital Document](https://docs.swissartresearch.net/et/do/)
+ [Events](https://docs.swissartresearch.net/et/event/)
+ [Bibliographic Entity](https://docs.swissartresearch.net/et/bibliographic_item)

Each of the Models listed above present an initial introduction of the sources and the methodology used for grounding the model. Following this introduction, each descriptor is defined, and its modelling in both textual and graphical form is provided to the reader.
